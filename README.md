# opencv-face-detection-project
A real-time face detection application built with Python and OpenCV. The system uses Haar Cascade classifiers to detect and count faces from live webcam input. Detection accuracy is improved through parameter tuning and frame resizing. The project demonstrates image processing, object detection, and real-time video analysis.
